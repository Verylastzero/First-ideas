# First-ideas
Ok so at this point, it's pretty much you and I building this thing. I am good at visually breaking down how it works in my mind, I just dont quite understand the functions to create that scenario.

so as a blank slate. the first user. which in most areas there will be lots of first users.

a visual comes up for login in, hello, this is the guide what is your name how can i help you? a space for location. 

**I had the intention of building a community gathering hall, I know some of the logistics..**

name entry info as desired ( in the way you can fill out a profile more in depth later the questions would be created by the system, by each user, but us as first users would ask lots of really good questions.)

a page shows up with blank simplicity having boxes showing,

Project

Food 

etc as described before, many questions. the boxes could be larger with the amount of use, or the amount of local use. eg: project being a large box and food(which would be in a format like project, but would probably tend toward being filled with different pieces.

click on Project 

start a project or join a project

**(visually acceptable boxes, trust me, once we get to User experience, we should have enough help, but always ask, like i said, everything I've written down pretty much comes to this and slightly more that I can describe as we go along that I see visually, but I'm almost passing the torch onto you as to how this is acheivable. and security, is that an issue? I feel like the coding should be used with github and made public eventually, right?**

start a project

**now the fun begins, because the very first person would have to build everything from scratch, which is what millions of users will be doing for the next so odd years until the system can evolve into much greater and greater accessibility as a database**

where? (type in address and access gis map of property boundaries as a layer superimposed on google maps(?)]

are you property owner? 

(we can classify different spaces as public like DNR, BLM, public squares and parks, and also peoples personal owned* property as a new kind of public space, a space we define through the guide as something like --- earth, shared and respected and responsible for by all. --within that category we can use parts of projects which help with research so it would be boxes that show information but can also be clicked on to expand information much farther, so basically abstracts or simple parts can be glanced at and then known with or without labeling what kind of information can be clicked on within(solving a lot of problems with links. links have their place but are mostly misleading. links can go to outside sources, but within the guide we should enter all information into boxes that can be seen visually on the screen and expanded as whole page to continue to scanned over)

In almost blank simplicity a project appears, it is now a project page begun.

there at first can be at least one box to edit, but possibly many and a sidebar to access maps information local projects etc.

clicking on the box expands it to enter in information 

now we as say first users before this first* user had opened those boxes and its totally blank, but we had opened boxes within those boxes to define categories. those categories could be things like

Housing
Food
Water
Energy
Waste
Meet/Social

So I click on housing

(and these very nice first users before me put things in like)::

Build or create
Repair
Show/share space (no renting or leasing property rather using language to show that you can share a space with someone share respect for that space and share responsibility for the space and all food and help that was shown along with the space and also where the food came from etc, though the project pages

i click build (

(So ideally people will be able to just type in the words like they would say --i want to build a community center and the program picks up

build- same as clicking on the box or both as an option
community center- then options are created like a sentence.. 

--i want to build a community center **(program kicks out)** WITH ____ PEOPLE INVOLVED,  FOR ----- PURPOSE, 

so i click on the box for *--- people* and fill in 100 and also type to eat meals, gather and meet, talk about growing broccolli, corn, daily greens, and winter melons

so the program is picking up and creating a data point and group of data points such as (gather and meet, talk* about - broccolli corn etc) like 

and linking those data points to his location, building within his project in a box (we as creators must make,one of our first algortihms...) created for this persons profile and or current project in a box that shows FOODS grown and then later he can fill in if its sharing, how its shared, how help is needed in growing it, etc until (like i said on the phone people will have so much help growing food because its free and shared they will see owning land as a burden...)

so now boxes are made for his project for 100 people

and he can open a box for tasks for his creation of a building which was his original goal, but already he has started making boxes and data points for all sorts of things like how his building will be shared and then later he can open those boxes and share the information like when and how and who)

so now a box within his project is created because he clicked on a task related box, which opens up a page that shows individual tasks, 

**so right now the project is young and wont have a lot of information in there, but you see more and more data points in the system will allow people to use algortihms and build within the system more intricate ways of directing and showing others successful or useful ways and also what areas need research.**

and say I have bought all the wood, all i need is the help of 12 guys for about 14 days, or something like that divided up into tasks

so i click on a task box and I can fill in things like(because my previous users have helped me format what i should be filling in, just as each continuous user should have as a peer, the same ability)

this task box slots say things like

hours (i enter in 60 hours, and the system creates basically automatically 4 hour blocks that contain all the information involved, but so we can automatically divide what someone knows takes about 40 hours or a work week to complete into actual divisible tasks in half day portions that can be accessed by the public)  --hours will be divided into manageable blocks, so no more that 24 hours. or a full day, and always divided into areas of time people can manage work or absolutely have to, like 20 minutes-5 hours at a time--

task (I type building foundation forms, our system pops up **ANY TRAINING REQUIRED and options like TRAINING PORVIDED -which stems to who is providing
how long does it take, TRAINING NEEDED , WHAT TRAINING -options like- things that we can build into the system as first users-- CARPENTRY, TRANSIT, SPECIFIC TOOLS, OR SPECIFIC TRADES OR ACTIONS WITHIN A TRADE --



difficulties **options like

lift 50 lbs, pound stakes, hold transit, shovel rocks,( all things that user can enter in and be counted as data points to be used in their other projects or profile and all projects and profiles will have that as an option because it has been used once in someones system as a viable sentence to describe an action or thing, thus allowing the system to create its own data language of acceptibility through current social conscience and use.



 
rest
two resting places for day naps and one tent for sleeping and waste provided for all three spaces 
** so now the system is picking up data points like resting places, amounts notes like day only and one night place that is a tent.
as the system fixes it a little, basically we can translate the data points and show when scrolled over a sentence what data points are actually gathered from that sentence and translated into usefulness in the system( the rest being just fill words we use in english and others)
so now this builds the ability for someone else to use the language 

nourishment

food provided at all meals and juice and salads in between for anyone working a 4 hour block

Ok I cut it off here. Post a comment when someone is ready for more.
